## Wireframes

In designing the layout for the Boops & Snoots Rescue website, I followed a mobile-first approach, ensuring the site is fully responsive across different device sizes. This method prioritises mobile design to provide a seamless user experience on smartphones, before adapting for tablet and desktop views. The wireframes were created using [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/), and below are the visual representations of the site’s structure and key elements across mobile, tablet, and desktop formats.

## Typography

For this project, Google Fonts was used to create a cohesive and accessible typography style:

- **Quicksand:** Used for the majority of the site’s content, including headings and body text. This font has a rounded, modern design that brings a fun, approachable, and positive vibe to the site, reflecting the welcoming nature of Boops & Snoots Rescue. It balances personality with professionalism, ensuring the site feels inviting yet trustworthy.
- **Lato:** Chosen for form inputs and areas where a more formal tone was needed. Lato is a clean, sans-serif font with excellent legibility, making it ideal for areas requiring a professional feel, such as forms and informational sections. It pairs seamlessly with Quicksand, ensuring a cohesive and accessible design.
  Both fonts were selected to ensure a balance between a friendly, approachable feel and professionalism, enhancing the overall user experience across the site.

## Colour Scheme

The website’s colour scheme was carefully selected using [Coolors](https://coolors.co/) to create a welcoming, engaging, and user-friendly experience. A combination of calm blues, warm highlights, and a clean neutral background aligns with _Boops & Snoots Rescue’s_ branding, reinforcing trust, positivity, and approachability.

- **Primary Colour – Dark Blue (#2D4A5B):** Used for text and headings, this deep blue conveys trust and stability.
- **Secondary Colour – Light Blue (#365B78):** Featured in the navigation bar and logo, ensuring brand consistency.
- **Primary Highlight – Orange (#E4810B):** A bold, warm and energetic colour used for call-to-action elements, drawing attention and encouraging interaction.
- **Secondary Highlight – Yellow (#FBC037):** A cheerful, uplifting colour used for hover effects and subtle separators.
- **Accent Colour – Light Yellow (#FFD978):** Enhances decorative elements, softening the design while keeping it cheerful.
- **Neutral Background – Light Grey (#F1EFE8A5):** Applied to the application and contact forms, ensuring readability while maintaining a light, friendly feel.

Additionally, white space (#FFFFFF) plays a key role in the design, keeping the interface clean, modern, and easy to navigate. The balance of blues, warm tones, and neutral shades creates a professional yet friendly aesthetic that reflects the mission of Boops & Snoots Rescue.

### Accessibility Considerations

Ensuring strong colour contrast for readability was a key design principle from the outset. Before development, the colour choices were tested using the [WebAIM Contrast Checker](https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/) to confirm compliance with WCAG (Web Content Accessibility Guidelines). The goal was to maintain high contrast ratios for text elements, particularly for call-to-action buttons and important information, ensuring the site is accessible to users with visual impairments or colour blindness.

    ![404 Screenshot](assets/media/404-screenshot.png)

### Navigation - Customised Boostrap Navbar

For the navigation bar on the Boops & Snoots Rescue website, I’ve used Bootstrap's responsive navbar component, which I customised to suit the branding and style of the site. The navbar is fully responsive, automatically adjusting its layout for smaller screens, and includes a toggle feature that allows users to easily access the navigation links on mobile devices.

I’ve customised the navbar with my own brand logo and text, ensuring that it reflects the playful and friendly vibe of the website. This customisation maintains the overall structure provided by Bootstrap, while enhancing the user experience by aligning it with the branding.

In addition to the custom logo and text, I’ve applied a hover effect to the navbar links, which changes their colour when users hover over them. This small but effective touch adds an interactive element to the navigation, making it more engaging while ensuring that the links are easy to identify and access.

#### Key Features:

- Fully Responsive: The navbar adapts dynamically to different screen sizes, featuring a toggle menu for improved mobile usability.
- Custom Branding: Added a custom brand logo and text to match the site’s playful tone.
- Hover Effects on Links: Links have colour-changing hover effects, making them visually interactive and easy to navigate.
- These customisations enhance the user experience by offering a sleek, responsive navigation system that allows users to quickly access key pages while maintaining the site’s branding and playful style.

Below are screenshots showing the full navbar (for larger screens) and the small-screen toggle navbar (for mobile and tablet view), highlighting how the layout adjusts to ensure a seamless user experience across all devices.

![Full Navbar](assets/media/full-navbar.png)

![Toggle Navbar](assets/media/toggle-navbar.png)

### Footer - Customised Bootstrap Layout with Interactive Links

For the footer on the Boops & Snoots Rescue website, I designed a layout utilizing Bootstrap's responsive container and grid system that adapts to both large and small screens. While the structure is based on Bootstrap, I’ve customised various elements to better align with the site’s branding and user experience. The footer contains essential information such as contact details, social media links, and a disclaimer, ensuring that users can easily access the information they need, regardless of the device they are using.

Key features include:

- **Interactive Contact Links:** The fictional address is linked to Google Maps, so clicking on it opens the map in a new tab (or in the app on mobile devices). The phone number is also linked, enabling users to open their default calling app, while the email address launches the default email client for easy communication.
- **Social Media Links:** Custom icons provide quick access to the rescue’s social media pages, allowing users to stay up to date with available pets and fundraising events.
- **Stylish Text Links:** To enhance visual appeal, I have added custom dashed-dot underline styles to text links, reinforcing the overall branding.
- **Hover Effects:** All links in the footer have a colour change hover effect, ensuring they are easily identifiable as interactive elements.
- **Override of Default Link Colours:** I have overridden the default blue hyperlinks to align with the website’s colour scheme and branding. This creates a consistent and cohesive look across all pages.
- **Opening Hours:** The footer includes fictional opening hours for the rescue centre, providing users with operational details at a glance.
- **Disclaimer:** At the bottom of the footer, I’ve added a disclaimer to clarify that the website is fictional and for educational or portfolio purposes only.

These features ensure that the footer provides essential information while remaining intuitive and user-friendly. Whether users are browsing on a desktop or mobile device, the footer remains accessible and functional.

## Other features

### _"...Because Every Snoot Deserves a Boop"_ - Custom Pointer, Modal and Video for Donations

To add a playful touch to the site, I have included a subtle "Easter egg" feature: a snoot (nose) image linked to a donation modal, accompanied by the phrase "Because Every Snoot Deserves a Boop" with an arrow pointing downwards. This fun and interactive element is designed to engage users while drawing attention to the donation section. While the main donation button remains easily visible below, this feature adds an extra layer of personality and encourages interaction.

This is an intentional part of the branding, ensuring that users can explore interactive elements while maintaining a clear and accessible donation pathway. It also showcases the interactive modal and video functionality, enhancing the user experience.

#### Custom Pointer and Hover Effects

![Custom Pointer](assets/media/hand-pointer-readme.png)

To highlight the nose image as an interactive element, I have implemented a custom pointer effect:

- **Custom Pointer:** When users hover over the nose image, the cursor changes to a finger pointer to resemble a "boop" action, inviting them to click.
- **Hover Effect:** The nose image scales up by 10% on hover, creating a dynamic effect that makes it feel more interactive and engaging.

#### Donation Modal with Video

When users click on the snoot image, a modal appears containing a short video of a cat enjoying a gentle snoot fuss, along with a clear call to action encouraging users to donate. The modal is designed to be user-friendly, providing an easy-to-access donation button that redirects users to the donation page.

Key features:

- **Custom Pointer Effect:** Reinforces interactivity by changing the cursor to a finger pointer.
- **Hover Scaling:** Increases the size of the snoot image slightly when hovered over.
- **Pop-up Modal:** Displays a heartwarming video of a cat’s snoot being fussed, paired with a message encouraging donations.
- **Clear Call to Action:** A direct donation button within the modal ensures easy navigation to the donation page.

These features allow users to engage with the site in a fun and meaningful way while maintaining control over their browsing experience. Users can play the video, close the modal, or proceed to the donation page at their own pace.

Below are screenshots demonstrating these features in action:

## Stretch Goals

As part of the initial planning phase, I identified additional pages and features that would enhance the website experience:

- **About Page** – A section detailing the organisation's history and mission.
- **Volunteer Page** – Information on volunteer roles, benefits, and how to apply. This page was also intended to include an application form for volunteers and an accordion-style FAQ section to address common questions about volunteering.
- **Gallery of Success Stories** – A collection of adopted animals and their happy endings.
- **Events Section** – A showcase of past fundraising events and a link to social media for updates.

I created wireframes and wrote content for these pages; however, during development, I reassessed the project scope and prioritized completing core features, validation checks, and ensuring overall site stability. Given that CSS changes could have a site-wide impact, I made the strategic decision to avoid last-minute additions that might introduce unintended issues.

These pages remain stretch goals for future development, and their wireframes are included below for reference:

## Future Enhancements

Since this is a static site, potential future updates could include:

- **Content Management System (CMS):** Allowing non-developers to easily update adoptable animals, events, and volunteer information without editing the code.
- **User Accounts & Applications:** Personalized experiences where potential adopters and volunteers can create accounts, submit applications, and track their progress.
- **API Integration:** Real time updates on adoptable animals and upcoming events.
- **Search & Filter Features:** A dynamic database allowing users to search for pets based on criteria such as age, breed, child-friendliness, and compatibility with other pets.
- **Online Donation Processing:** Integrated payment platforms for direct donations.
- **Enhanced Interactivity:** Features like regular blog updates to engage the community.
- **Newsletter Signup:** An email subscription system for updates, events, and adoption stories.
- **Merchandise Store:** Selling branded items like t-shirts and mugs to raise funds and increase brand visibility.
- **Interactive Event Calendar:** A live-updating calendar where users can register for upcoming fundraising and adoption events.
- **Community Forum or Blog:** A space for adopters to share updates and for the rescue to post success stories and training tips.

As Boops & Snoots Rescue continues to grow — welcoming more animals, expanding to new locations, and increasing its reach — the demand for these enhancements would naturally increase. While this project remains a static website, these theoretical future updates would improve usability, streamline the adoption process, and provide more ways for supporters to engage with and contribute to the organisation.
