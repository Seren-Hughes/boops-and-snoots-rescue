## Wireframes
In designing the layout for the Boops & Snoots Rescue website, I followed a mobile-first approach, ensuring the site is fully responsive across different device sizes. This method prioritises mobile design to provide a seamless user experience on smartphones, before adapting for tablet and desktop views. The wireframes were created using [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/), and below are the visual representations of the site’s structure and key elements across mobile, tablet, and desktop formats.

## Typography
For this project, Google Fonts was used to create a cohesive and accessible typography style:
- **Quicksand:** Used for the majority of the site’s content, including headings and body text. This font has a rounded, modern design that brings a fun, approachable, and positive vibe to the site, reflecting the welcoming nature of Boops & Snoots Rescue. It balances personality with professionalism, ensuring the site feels inviting yet trustworthy.
- **Lato:** Chosen for form inputs and areas where a more formal tone was needed. Lato is a clean, sans-serif font with excellent legibility, making it ideal for areas requiring a professional feel, such as forms and informational sections. It pairs seamlessly with Quicksand, ensuring a cohesive and accessible design.
Both fonts were selected to ensure a balance between a friendly, approachable feel and professionalism, enhancing the overall user experience across the site.


## Colour Scheme
The website’s colour scheme was carefully selected using [Coolors](https://coolors.co/) to create a welcoming, engaging, and user-friendly experience. A combination of calm blues, warm highlights, and a clean neutral background aligns with *Boops & Snoots Rescue’s* branding, reinforcing trust, positivity, and approachability.

- **Primary Colour – Dark Blue (#2D4A5B):** Used for text and headings, this deep blue conveys trust and stability.
- **Secondary Colour – Light Blue (#365B78):** Featured in the navigation bar and logo, ensuring brand consistency.
- **Primary Highlight – Orange (#E4810B):** A bold, warm and energetic colour used for call-to-action elements, drawing attention and encouraging interaction.
- **Secondary Highlight – Yellow (#FBC037):** A cheerful, uplifting color used for hover effects and subtle separators.
- **Accent Colour – Light Yellow (#FFD978):** Enhances decorative elements, softening the design while keeping it cheerful.
- **Neutral Background – Light Grey (#F1EFE8A5):** Applied to the application and contact forms, ensuring readability while maintaining a light, friendly feel.

Additionally, white space (#FFFFFF) plays a key role in the design, keeping the interface clean, modern, and easy to navigate. The balance of blues, warm tones, and neutral shades creates a professional yet friendly aesthetic that reflects the mission of Boops & Snoots Rescue.

### Accessibility Considerations
Ensuring strong colour contrast for readability was a priority. Before development, the colour choices were tested using the [WebAIM Contrast Checker](https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/) to confirm compliance with WCAG (Web Content Accessibility Guidelines). The goal was to maintain high contrast ratios for text elements, particularly for call-to-action buttons and important information, ensuring the site is accessible to users with visual impairments or colour blindness.

### Custom Pointer and Modal for Donations
As part of the interactive features on the Boops & Snoots Rescue website, I have implemented a custom pointer to highlight the snoot (nose) image on the page. This visual cue encourages users to interact with the donation link, creating a playful and engaging experience.

In addition to the custom pointer, the nose/snoot image itself has a hover effect. When users hover over the image, it scales up by 10%. This effect adds a subtle yet fun and dynamic touch, making the snoot/nose image feel more interactive and engaging.

Additionally, I added a modal that pops up when the user clicks on the snoot image. The modal contains a short video of a cat enjoying a gentle snoot fuss, accompanied by a call to action encouraging visitors to donate to support the rescue efforts. The modal is designed to be user-friendly, with easy access to a donation button that redirects users to the donation page.

Here’s a brief overview of the features:

- **Custom Large Pointer:** Changes the cursor to a custom finger pointer when hovering over the snoot image to look like a boop action, inviting users to click.
- **Hover Effect:** Scales the snoot image by 10% when hovered over, making it more interactive.
- **Modal with Video:** Displays a sweet video of a cat's snoot being gently fussed, alongside a heartfelt message asking users to support the rescue.

Below are screenshots showing these features in action:

## Deployment

#### Creating Repository on GitHub
- First make sure you are signed into [Github](https://github.com/) and go to the code institutes template, which can be found [here](https://github.com/Code-Institute-Org/gitpod-full-template).
- Then click on **use this template** and select **Create a new repository** from the drop-down. Enter the name for the repository and click **Create repository from template**.
- Once the repository was created, I clicked the green **gitpod** button to create a workspace in gitpod so that I could write the code for the site.
#### Deloying on Github
The site was deployed to Github Pages using the following method:
- Go to the Github repository.
- Navigate to the 'settings' tab.
- Using the 'select branch' dropdown menu, choose 'main'.
- Click 'save'.

## Future Enhancements
Since this is a static site, potential future updates could include:
-	A CMS for easier content management
-	User accounts for personalized experiences
-	API integration for real-time updates on adoptable animals and events
-	Search and filter features for adoptable animals (e.g., age, breed, child-friendliness, ability to live with other pets)
-	Online donation processing via integrated payment platforms
-	Enhanced interactivity with features like regular blog updates
-	Newsletter signup for updates, events and adoption stories
- Merchandise store to sell branded items like t-shirts and mugs to raise funds and increase brand visibility

As Boops & Snoots Rescue continues to grow — welcoming more animals, expanding to new locations, and increasing its reach — the demand for these enhancements would naturally increase. These future updates would make it easier to adopt pets, and provide a fun way for supporters to contribute while spreading the word about the organization.
