## Wireframes
In designing the layout for the Boops & Snoots Rescue website, I followed a mobile-first approach, ensuring the site is fully responsive across different device sizes. This method prioritises mobile design to provide a seamless user experience on smartphones, before adapting for tablet and desktop views. The wireframes were created using [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/), and below are the visual representations of the site’s structure and key elements across mobile, tablet, and desktop formats.

## Typography
For this project, Google Fonts was used to create a cohesive and accessible typography style:
- **Quicksand:** Used for the majority of the site’s content, including headings and body text. This font has a rounded, modern design that brings a fun, approachable, and positive vibe to the site, reflecting the welcoming nature of Boops & Snoots Rescue. It balances personality with professionalism, ensuring the site feels inviting yet trustworthy.
- **Lato:** Chosen for form inputs and areas where a more formal tone was needed. Lato is a clean, sans-serif font with excellent legibility, making it ideal for areas requiring a professional feel, such as forms and informational sections. It pairs seamlessly with Quicksand, ensuring a cohesive and accessible design.
Both fonts were selected to ensure a balance between a friendly, approachable feel and professionalism, enhancing the overall user experience across the site.


## Colour Scheme
The website’s colour scheme was carefully selected using [Coolors](https://coolors.co/) to create a welcoming, engaging, and user-friendly experience. A combination of calm blues, warm highlights, and a clean neutral background aligns with *Boops & Snoots Rescue’s* branding, reinforcing trust, positivity, and approachability.

- **Primary Colour – Dark Blue (#2D4A5B):** Used for text and headings, this deep blue conveys trust and stability.
- **Secondary Colour – Light Blue (#365B78):** Featured in the navigation bar and logo, ensuring brand consistency.
- **Primary Highlight – Orange (#E4810B):** A bold, warm and energetic colour used for call-to-action elements, drawing attention and encouraging interaction.
- **Secondary Highlight – Yellow (#FBC037):** A cheerful, uplifting color used for hover effects and subtle separators.
- **Accent Colour – Light Yellow (#FFD978):** Enhances decorative elements, softening the design while keeping it cheerful.
- **Neutral Background – Light Grey (#F1EFE8A5):** Applied to the application and contact forms, ensuring readability while maintaining a light, friendly feel.

Additionally, white space (#FFFFFF) plays a key role in the design, keeping the interface clean, modern, and easy to navigate. The balance of blues, warm tones, and neutral shades creates a professional yet friendly aesthetic that reflects the mission of Boops & Snoots Rescue.

### Accessibility Considerations
Ensuring strong colour contrast for readability was a priority. Before development, the colour choices were tested using the [WebAIM Contrast Checker](https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/) to confirm compliance with WCAG (Web Content Accessibility Guidelines). The goal was to maintain high contrast ratios for text elements, particularly for call-to-action buttons and important information, ensuring the site is accessible to users with visual impairments or colour blindness.

### Navigation - Customised Boostrap Navbar
For the navigation bar on the Boops & Snoots Rescue website, I’ve used Bootstrap's responsive navbar component, which I customised to suit the branding and style of the site. The navbar is fully responsive, automatically adjusting its layout for smaller screens, and includes a toggle feature that allows users to easily access the navigation links on mobile devices.

I’ve customised the navbar with my own brand logo and text, ensuring that it reflects the playful and friendly vibe of the website. This customisation maintains the overall structure provided by Bootstrap, while enhancing the user experience by aligning it with the branding.

In addition to the custom logo and text, I’ve applied a hover effect to the navbar links, which changes their colour when users hover over them. This small but effective touch adds an interactive element to the navigation, making it more engaging while ensuring that the links are easy to identify and access.

#### Key Features:

- Responsive Layout: The navbar automatically adjusts for smaller screens and includes a toggle feature for easier - navigation on mobile devices.
- Custom Branding: Added a custom brand logo and text to match the site’s playful tone.
- Hover Effects on Links: Links have colour-changing hover effects, making them visually interactive and easy to navigate.
- These customisations enhance the user experience by offering a sleek, responsive navigation system that allows users to quickly access key pages while maintaining the site’s branding and playful style.

Below are screenshots showing the full navbar (for larger screens) and the small-screen toggle navbar (for mobile and tablet view), highlighting how the layout adjusts to ensure a seamless user experience across all devices.

### Footer - Customised Bootstrap Layout with Interactive Links
For the footer on the Boops & Snoots Rescue website, I designed a layout utilizing Bootstrap's responsive container and grid system that adapts to both large and small screens. While the structure is based on Bootstrap, I’ve custom-styled various elements to better align with the site’s branding and user experience. The footer contains essential information such as contact details, social media links, and a disclaimer, ensuring that users can easily access the information they need, regardless of the device they are using.

Key features include:

- **Interactive Contact Links:** I’ve linked the made-up address to Google Maps, so when users click on it, it opens the location in a new tab. The phone number is also linked, so clicking on it will open Skype (or whatever the default calling app is on the user's device), while the email address is linked to open the default email client, allowing users to easily contact the rescue.
- **Social Media Links:** Custom icons for the rescue’s social media profiles are included, making it easy for users to stay connected for updates.
- **Stylish Text Links:** For visual appeal, I added custom dashed dot links under the text, which is also part of the overall branding style.
- **Hover Effects:** All links in the footer have a colour change hover effect, ensuring they are easily identifiable as interactive elements.
- **Override of Default Link Colours:** I’ve overridden the default blue hyperlinks (typically used for text links) to better align with the site’s colour scheme and branding. This gives the website a cohesive look and ensures that all interactive links are styled consistently.
- **Opening Hours:** The footer includes the made-up opening hours for the rescue centre, providing users with important operational details.
- **Disclaimer:** At the bottom of the footer, I’ve added a disclaimer to clarify that the website is fictional and for educational or portfolio purposes only.

These features ensure that the footer not only provides essential information but also offers an intuitive, user-friendly experience. Whether users are navigating the site on a desktop or mobile device, the footer remains accessible and functional.

Below are screenshots showing the full footer layout (for larger screens) and the small-screen footer (for mobile view), demonstrating how the layout adjusts to ensure a seamless user experience.

## Other features
### *"...Because Every Snoot Deserves a Boop"* - Custom Pointer and Modal for Donations
To add a bit of playfulness to the site, I’ve included a subtle "Easter egg" feature: the snoot/nose image, linked to a donation Modal, is paired with the phrase "Because Every Snoot Deserves a Boop" and an arrow pointing down. It's a light-hearted touch designed to make the site more engaging, and while I hope users will notice it, I’ve also made sure the donation button underneath is easy to find in case they miss this feature.

This feature is intentional and part of the fun branding, offering an unexpected way for users to interact with the site. It also showcases the interactive modal and video functionality I’ve implemented, encouraging donations in a playful and engaging manner, while still providing a clear and accessible path to support the rescue.

As part of the interactive features on the Boops & Snoots Rescue website, I have implemented a custom pointer that highlights the snoot (nose) image. This visual cue guides users toward the donation link, adding a playful touch and clearly indicating that it’s interactive. By changing the cursor to a finger pointer when hovering over the snoot image, users can easily identify the area where they can initiate an action, such as triggering the pop-up modal and playing the video.

The hover effect further enhances this interaction: when users hover over the snoot image, it scales up by 10%, making it feel more dynamic and inviting. This ensures that users can clearly engage with the image and are encouraged to click.

When users click on the snoot image, a modal pops up containing a short video of a cat enjoying a gentle snoot fuss, along with a clear call to action encouraging users to donate to support the rescue. The modal is designed to be user-friendly, providing easy access to a donation button that redirects users to the donation page. This ensures a seamless, controlled interaction where users can initiate actions, close the modal, and navigate back to the main content without frustration.

Here’s a brief overview of the features:

- **Custom Large Pointer:** Changes the cursor to a custom finger pointer when hovering over the snoot image to look like a boop action, inviting users to click.
- **Hover Effect:** Scales the snoot image by 10% when hovered over, making it more interactive.
- **Modal with Video:** Displays a sweet video of a cat's snoot being gently fussed, alongside a heartfelt message asking users to support the rescue.

These features are designed to give users full control over their interaction with the site, allowing them to play the video, close the modal, and navigate to the donation page at their own pace.

Below are screenshots showing these features in action:

## Future Enhancements
Since this is a static site, potential future updates could include:
-	A CMS for easier content management
-	User accounts for personalized experiences
-	API integration for real-time updates on adoptable animals and events
-	Search and filter features for adoptable animals (e.g., age, breed, child-friendliness, ability to live with other pets)
-	Online donation processing via integrated payment platforms
-	Enhanced interactivity with features like regular blog updates
-	Newsletter signup for updates, events and adoption stories
- Merchandise store to sell branded items like t-shirts and mugs to raise funds and increase brand visibility

As Boops & Snoots Rescue continues to grow — welcoming more animals, expanding to new locations, and increasing its reach — the demand for these enhancements would naturally increase. These future updates would make it easier to adopt pets, and provide a fun way for supporters to contribute while spreading the word about the organization.
